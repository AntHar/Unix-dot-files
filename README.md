# Unix-dot-files

This repository aims to achieve the highest beauty in terms of Mac OS X and Ubuntu configuration dot-files.  
This goal is not too ambitious since we are starting from my personal settings (he, he, he :wink:) which could be improved with forking and pull-requesting further updates.
